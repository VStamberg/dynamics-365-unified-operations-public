# Regulatory updates

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic lists the regulatory updates that are planned for release in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations supported localizations. Delivery timelines might change, and projected functionality might change or might not be released. Read [Microsoft policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007332) for more information. 

Regulatory updates are features that are implemented to support new or changed country-specific legislation. To learn about other planned and released country-specific features, refer to the following resources:

- [Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Release Notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/index)
- [What's new for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/whats-new-changed.md)

Microsoft strives to implement new regulatory requirements as early as possible. The actual delivery date depends on the law announcement date, availability of the requirement details from the local authorities, the availability of the validation tools, and on the size and complexity of the change. 

We plan to deliver regulatory updates in One Version service updates that are released in time for customers to update and be ready for the enforcement date (for transactional regulatory updates), or for the first mandatory reporting deadline (for regulatory updates related to reporting). Customers and partners can preview the new regulatory updates in the Preview Early Adoption Program (PEAP).

In case of late announcement dates, late availability of requirement details or validation tools, or exceptionally large and complex changes, it might not be possible to make a regulatory update available by the General Availability date of a monthly update. In these cases, the regulatory update will be shipped as hot fixes for some available monthly updates.

For the latest regulatory update plans, refer to the following table.
